Live van fleet tracker with traffic routing (TomTom) and useful nearby features like fuel and truck stops (OverpassAPI)


The aim of this project is to make a fleet track that uses live location and placed locations to find the best route and travel time of point to point using TomTom routing API. I also aim to include useful POIs along the way like truck stops and petrol stations using Overpass (diesel in this case i guess). The project will have to be cloud deployed, likely aws or azure (student tier).
